## in this readme txt file, i am going to explain the most important and newest things i've learned through this project.

1. thing that was slightly hidden from me was the how to make the 'to top' button --> and I figured it out from zero web school.
2. making the event listerner of clicking and showing the list was easy but with remembering some details from udacity course, i could solve it.
3. remember to call the function after finishing its code. #call the function.
4. adding and removing classes using classlist property is the only way to hid and reshow elements.
